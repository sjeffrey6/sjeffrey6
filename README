Hello, my name is Savannah Jeffrey! 
I am a student at Stonehill College in MA. I am studying biology, and have interest in the research field, specifically the field of medicine. 
My goals over the next 5 years include beginning biological research at my college with a professor to build a strong background in research methods. I also hope to graduate Stonehill with a solid academic rapport and enter into a good graduate program. I hope to pinpoint exactly what my career choice will be and begin that journey. 
My portfolio includes projects and assignments from a course taken through Stonehill, R Programming for Biologists. as well as a function tutorial on the lterpalettefinder package!
